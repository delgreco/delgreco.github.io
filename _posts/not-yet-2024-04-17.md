## Debugging API Calls Like A ~~Boss~~ Boob

Recently, I stood up a simple JSON web service on Apache in my usual way, the basis for an API for new client calls to be expected from a commercial system used in $dayjob.

The calls from the commerical system hung.  And hung.  And finally timed out.

Friends, your author gets perplexed more easily than you might suspect.  When a certain approach works, and works, and continues to work some two decades or more running... the mind grows lazy.  Happy experience creates a box diffcult to think outside of.

Inside this mental box, I couldn't believe these client calls were even making it to my server.  What's a hang?  It's the network, of course.  It's always the network, when things are hanging.  Right?

After careful research (okay fine, after a conversation with chatGPT and various AIs) I arrived at the following effective `tcpdump` command with human readable output, and I was able to see...

```
sudo tcpdump -i [network interface] -n -t -vv -X -A src [IP address]
```

... that I was wrong (gasp!): the client call *was* making it to my server.  Something *else* had to be hanging things up.

...  more exposition ...

```
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    RequestHeader unset Expect early
</IfModule>
```

... conclusions ...

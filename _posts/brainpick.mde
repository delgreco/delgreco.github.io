## Keep An Open Mind About AI

Like the rest of you, I've been keeping a close eye on the burgeoning AI revolution with hope of understanding *it* before *it* understands *me*.  Good luck to us all.

An early development has been the reaction of intellectual property holders to having their content included in the training of Large Language Models (LLMs).  Entities like the NY Times have [sued to stop](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/why-the-new-york-times-might-win-its-copyright-lawsuit-against-openai/) their inclusion (or, more accurately, their uncompensated inclusion) in training datasets.

Fair enough.  But what does this mean for AI's understanding of technical knowledge such as programming languages?  I wanted to know what chatGPT (3.5, the free one) thought:

It's clear that open source succeeds in this aspect, making its knowledge public by design, and therefore being incorporated comprehensively in these first LLMs, in these amazing new teachers that will be teaching the next generation of developers.
